<div>Suddenly there was a sudden error. A planet where everyone is friendly folk: elves and dwarves. </div>

Gnomes really like to work, to extract minerals in the bowels of their small planet: precious stones and metals. However, the resources they produce do not interest them in themselves - they like the process itself.

Hard physics - they spend their leisure time dancing and singing. They still love the beautiful stones that have been dug in their mines. Elves decorated their robes and tree huts.

This year, the two peoples will be able to conclude a trade agreement: they will send their brilliant finds.

However, the elves soon began to get more upset than ever. Sometimes they bring him topaz! Some types of stones were in short supply. And yet, like many others, no one could!

They were all very kind to you after they got access. You decided to create an information system that should match the personal preferences of each of them. I want to do something like this.
